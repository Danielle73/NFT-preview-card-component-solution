## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Within this challenge I learnt how to create an image overlay and applying that only onto the main image. This challenge called for a lot of revision and solidifying css concepts. 

### Continued development

In future I'd look to reviewing this code and seeing where it could be further streamlined.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools image overlay tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay_icon.asp) - This was a great resource in being a template and tutorial in achieving an image overlay.
- [w3schools css positioning](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_position.asp) - Great for understanding positioning when it came to applying the overlay for the active state of the image. 
- [w3schools css image transparency](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_transparency.asp) - Good revision reminder in order to stop the opacity of the eye icon against the opacity of the background color. 
- [w3schools css cusor property](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_cursor.asp) - Cusor properties for the pointer cursor in the active state.
